To make Air tools II work with our own image, I changed arguments of the function of testprobs/paralleltomo.m to include the name of the .mat file to be reconstructed and in the fuction definition, I changed the first argument of phantomgallery to the argument that indicates the name of the .mat file to be used.
In phantomgallery.m, in the function definition, there are many cases depending on what the first argument is. I modified the 'otherwise' case to load the file name given in the first argument.
I made changes to radon-iradon file as well by cropping the original image and removing the borders of the final image obtained and got the ssim values, none of which are negative.
From the ssim values, among the interpolations, spline > linear > nearest.
Among the filters, ram-lak > shepp-logan > cosine > hamming > hann
